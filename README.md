# JS211_modulePractice
create a new repo called: " Module Practice "
clone it and npm init it.
then follow the NPM instructions: npm i --save lodash
then, in your js file at the top add: import _ from 'lodash'
And you're done!! Now you can make a fetch request to some API of your choice and use the methods in lodash to manipulate the data you get back.
Try it yourself!!! Go to lodash documentation and start finding methods you find interesting. See if you can use a few of them.
Honestly, this is how you get good.
This is how you get jobs.
You nerd out about this fun stuff!!
